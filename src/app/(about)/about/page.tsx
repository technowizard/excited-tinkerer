        Hi, I&apos;m Fadhil ðŸ‘‹ A software engineer based in Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©
      </h1>

      <p>
        I started my career working as a cloud engineer at one of the biggest
        telco companies in Indonesia. After two years of working, I decided to
        shift my career as a frontend engineer since I was interested in UI/UX
        design, while I think web app development is getting more interesting
        from time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I found that the frontend area is always evolving and constantly
        changing, also we are living in the Information Age that many platforms
        or services have their web apps where visual and interaction design have
        a significant role to its users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I combine ideas, creativity, and problem solving to achieve a great user
        experience. I enjoy spending my time to learn something new by reading
        books or articles, and sometimes I play video games too.
      </p>
